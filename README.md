### Summary
Brad Traversy is a great teacher. He clearly communicates the details of each step in his walkthroughs and makes everything easy to pick up. I started this course to practice familiar react concepts. The last 30 minutes introduced me to working with the backend. It was completely new to me. I plan on checking out his react router v6 video, other Next JS projects, fCC courses, and more to get into this side of things in the near future. For such a simple looking app, I'm surprised how much I used and learned while working through this tutorial.
